The following changes were made in this version:

| Type | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| feature | Replaced tension TextBox with slider. |
| feature | Added warning if more than 5000 puzzle pieces are generated, because it will probably lag the application. |
| feature | Added button to generate puzzle pattern and save it directly to a file. (So the pattern is not displayed in the application). This allows for generation of larger puzzle patterns. |
| feature | Puzzle pattern generation now runs asynchronously, so the application should not be unrespondable. |
